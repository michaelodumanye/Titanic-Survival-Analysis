# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains data and code for analyzing the survival factors in the Titanic dataset. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this project aims to explore the demographics and circumstances influencing passenger survival during the tragic event that occurred on April 15, 1912.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and other relevant features. The dataset allows us to examine patterns and trends to determine which groups of people were more likely to survive the disaster.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive the Titanic disaster. By examining the data and conducting statistical analysis, we aim to understand the factors that contributed to survival rates among passengers.

## Contents
